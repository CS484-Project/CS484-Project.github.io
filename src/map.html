        <h1>How to Use the Map</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>General Use</h2>
        <hr>
          <p> 
            <ol>
            <li>The target of our research was Alaska, so let's 
            click and drag on the map up and to the left a 
            bit until we find Alaska. It should be a large open area 
          to the left of Canada.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Once you've found Alaska, we can navigate over
              the 'Land Cover Dynamics' tab on the left hand
              side of the map.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Now we can select 'Land Cover Dynamics' and
              click on the 'Tree Cover Loss' button so it
              slides to the right.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>At this point a bunch of red dots should appear
              on the map! This represents large clusters of
              tree area coverage when measured within the given
              year on the timeline. However! It is important
              to note that Tree Cover Loss does not equal
              deforestation - but, it is a large contributing factor.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Now, using the slider that appeared, you can manipulate
              from what years of the dataset are showing. This way you can 
              see the progression of tree-cover loss from 2001 - 2022.
            </li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <br>
        <h2>Advanced Features</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>In the modal we were just navigating in, there are three 
          tabs at the top. If you navigate to the first one from the 
          right, and when you hover it says 'Analysis', clicking
          on this tab will give you instructions on all of the tools
          available at your disposal. Once you get a hang of these tools,
          you can click on the middle tab on the right-hand side menu.
          Here you can dive further into some data analysis of the shapes you made.
