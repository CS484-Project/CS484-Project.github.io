    <p>Forestr is a desktop application used to track and model the deforestation occurring in Alaska, and can be used as a tool to help educate and inform the 
      public about the effects of deforestation and how it further impacts the environment in Alaska. Some ways the application does this is by displaying 
      deforestation patterns over time, and also an interactive food web which offers information based on the animal affected.</p>

      <div class="column-right">
    <p>We decided to focus on the loss of biodiversity in Alaska. Biodiversity loss is primarily caused by deforestation, but not exclusively. Considering that, 
      there are confounding factors impacting biodiversity, we also wanted to include road construction, oil drilling, logging, and bycatching. We then went through 
      different species that are directly or indirectly affected by the issues listed.</p>
