        <p>
          Forestr is a desktop application used to track and model the deforestation occurring in Alaska, and can be used as a tool to help educate and inform the 
          public about the effects of deforestation and how it further impacts the environment in Alaska. Some ways the application does this is by displaying 
          deforestation patterns over time, and also an interactive food web which offers information based on the animal affected. There is also a real life listing 
          of tweets pertaining to deforestation and the global climate crisis.

        <p>We decided to focus on the loss of biodiversity in Alaska. Biodiversity loss is primarily caused by deforestation, but not exclusively. Considering that, 
          there are confounding factors impacting biodiversity, we also wanted to include road construction, oil drilling, logging, and bycatching. We then went through 
          different species that are directly or indirectly affected by the issues listed. </p>

        <p>
          Deforestation has been a massive global problem for most forests in the world. Deforestation directly limits the native biodiversity and harms the health of the 
          environment. The decrease in biodiversity and further harm to the environment can especially impact ecosystems and ecotones (ecosystems that sit at a transition 
          from one environment to another). Considering that some of the more prevalent ecosystems in Alaska like estuaries and wetlands are more sensitive to narrowing 
          biodiversity from deforestation. The sensitivity comes from these ecosystems being very niche.

        <p>
          Road construction often combines deforestation (to clear the path of the road) and pollution (via the use of heavy machinery). This simultaneously destroys the homes
           of local wildlife and harms the surrounding environment. For instance, road building can cause alkaline dust to settle on topsoil, which negatively impacts plant 
           development and health. In Alaska, there is currently a proposal for a 211-mile long industrial road through untouched wilderness. If approved, this road construction 
           would disrupt Native Alaskan communities as well as the animals that call the forest home.
