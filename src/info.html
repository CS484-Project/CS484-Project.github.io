        <p> Deforestation has been a massive global problem for most forests in the world. Deforestation directly limits the native biodiversity and harms the health of the 
          environment. The decrease in biodiversity and further harm to the environment can especially impact ecosystems and ecotones (ecosystems that sit at a transition 
          from one environment to another). Considering that some of the more prevalent ecosystems in Alaska like estuaries and wetlands are more sensitive to narrowing 
          biodiversity from deforestation. The sensitivity comes from these ecosystems being very niche.

        <p>
          Road construction often combines deforestation (to clear the path of the road) and pollution (via the use of heavy machinery). This simultaneously destroys the homes
           of local wildlife and harms the surrounding environment. For instance, road building can cause alkaline dust to settle on topsoil, which negatively impacts plant 
           development and health. In Alaska, there is currently a proposal for a 211-mile long industrial road through untouched wilderness. If approved, this road construction 
           would disrupt Native Alaskan communities as well as the animals that call the forest home.

          Oil drilling is another large contributor to the loss of biodiversity and general climate issues. Not only does this create air pollution, but also the drilling itself 
          disrupts the natural ecosystems that drills are placed in. They are loud and can create seismic vibrations which have disturbed migration patterns. That being said, oil 
          drilling also contributes to sound pollution and thus fragmenting animals’ communication especially to find mate(s). This goes without saying the risk of oil spills 
          which produce massive amounts of pollution in the soil, air, and water. These spills inevitably impact animals as well when the effects of pollution make its way up 
          the food web.

          Logging has contributed greatly to the deforestation thus loss of biodiversity occurring in Alaska. From 2001 to 2022, Alaska lost 6.22 
          million hectares of relative tree cover. This loss is equivalent to a 100% decrease since 2000 and 13% of the global total. That being 
          said, out of the United States, Alaska lost the most tree coverage out of all the states, beating Georgia (the runner-up) two fold. 
          Alaska is also home to the top five regions responsible for the majority of all tree cover loss between 2000 and 2022. Yukon-Koyukuk 
          county is single-handedly responsible for 74% of all tree cover loss between 2000 and 2022, seeing 4.61 million hectares of tree cover 
          loss. This sort of tree cover loss seen in old-growth forests can be very detrimental to all organisms since everything from microbes 
          like bacteria to fungi to the critters to the plants to trees that are impacted. There are many symbiotic relationships between organisms 
          that are completely ruined following logging operations, and take 150+ years to regrow to a fully restored old-growth forest.

          Bycatch refers to when fishermen catch and discard animals that they don’t want, can’t sell, and/or are not allowed to keep. 
          Bycatch can be fish, but also marine mammals, sea turtles, sea birds, etc. all of which can get entangled/hooked in fishing 
          gear. Over the past 10 years, Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska trawl fleets killed and discarded 141 million pounds of various 
          fishes and crustaceans species per year. This not only negatively impacts the species themselves, but also causes closures 
          and reduced accessibility to community-based fisheries local to Alaska. Bycatch is not a primary factor in biodiversity loss, 
          but rather a compounding variable as bycatch continues to lower populations of fishes and other animal species.

          Increasing global temperature due to human activity is causing the glaciers and sea ice to melt at a rapid pace. This is not only destructive 
          to the animals that call the ice home, but it also causes negative impacts that can be felt across the world. The mixing of cold glacial-melt 
          with warmer water causes the ocean currents to slow, impacting oceanic communities and the global climate. Melting ice causes sea levels to 
          rise which erodes shorelines, contributes to flooding, and destroys low-lying habitats. Finally, harmful algae blooms result from ice melt 
          releasing once-trapped algae into warm water, allowing it to grow out of control and produce deadly toxins which impact fish, birds, and 
          mammals – even humans.

          The first step is to recognize that there is a problem and inform yourself on it – which you are doing right now through this app! So, 
          congratulations! The second step is to decide what you’re going to do about the problem. Making your personal life as sustainable as possible 
          is a great way to combat many issues of climate change which compound the problems in Alaska. Informing others, perhaps by showing them to this 
          app, is another great step. In order to directly slow deforestation in Alaska, however, we suggest that you get involved with an organization 
          that is fighting for the same goal. If you live in Alaska, you can volunteer for the organization. If not, donations are always a wonderful 
          way to make an impact. We recommend donating to the Alaska Conservation Foundation or The Nature Conservancy in Alaska.
